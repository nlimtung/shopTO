<h1>shoplocalTO</h1>

## Intro

As small businesses are forced to move online in order to survive, there is a rising need for a free platform to help them with discoverability and advertising. This project, titled shoplocalTO, provides a platform for small businesses to make and manage their business profiles for anyone to view.

## Getting started

[Click here to open the website (opens on current page)](https://shoplocalTO.herokuapp.com/)

An account is not required to see all the listings on the website. However, to list a business, one has to create an account. Account creation and credentialing is done using Django Authentication. Once logged in, users can list a company, delete their company, view their company's detail page, and update details of their company. Users that create a company page will be able to add product listings associated with their company.

Logged in users can also create a favourites list where they can save all the companies they want to keep track of.
